        <h3>Don't Have a Code?</h3>
        <p>This website was built for a select few who were provided with a certain code.
            <br>If you happen to not have a code, and think you should have one, please contact<br>
            Michael Cragun. He will help you with the selected code?

        <h3>What is this place?</h3>
        <p>This website is a way for me to provide Christmas options to those whom might be<br>
            close to me, or to those who I select and would like to do something for! This was<br>
            all made by hand, so I hope you like it!</p>
